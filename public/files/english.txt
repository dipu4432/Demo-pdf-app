1⭐ Summary of Your Fluency Improvement Areas

You express ideas very clearly, but your fluency is affected by:

grammar mistakes

simple or broken sentence connectors

unnatural phrasing

Good news? These are all trainable skills. With practice, you can reach B2 fluency.



2 ⚠️ Lack of coherent structure

When answering questions, you sometimes forget to:

start with a main point

give supporting details

end with a conclusion

This makes your answers feel incomplete.

For example:

“That day is a memorable experience of my life.”

Good idea, but it needs details like:

why?

what happened?

how did you feel?

A coherent version:

“That day is memorable because my family surprised me, and I felt very loved.”

⭐ Overall Coherence Rating: “Developing but strong ideas”

Your strengths:

You know what you want to say

Your ideas are good

Listeners can understand the main point

Your weaknesses:

You don’t connect ideas smoothly

Sometimes sentence order is not logical

You jump between points without signaling transitions

⭐ In Simple Terms:

Your ideas are strong,
but the way you connect your sentences needs improvement.

Once you improve grammar + connectors + natural phrasing,
your coherence will automatically rise to B2 level.

⭐ 1. GRAMMAR — Your Current Situation
✅ What you do well

You can express full ideas

You use basic tenses (present/past) correctly most of the time

Your sentences are understandable even with mistakes

⚠️ Where you need improvement

Here are the grammar areas that reduce your fluency:

1. Sentence structure

Sometimes your sentence order is unnatural:

“My regular routine is wake up at 7 am”
Correct: “My regular routine is to wake up at 7 am.”

2. Verb forms

“They invites my friends.”
Correct: “They invited my friends.”

“I spend some work with family.”
Correct: “I spend some time with my family.”

3. Articles

You often miss “a / an / the”:

“I want to publish series of my own books.”
Correct: “I want to publish a series of my own books.”

4. Prepositions

Examples:

in → a place or year

at → time

on → day/date

These small words matter for fluency.

⭐ Overall Grammar Level: A2 → B1

You can speak clearly, but your grammar is not fully accurate yet.
